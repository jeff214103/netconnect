# NetConnect

NetConnect is a personal network management tool built with Flutter Web. It combines the clean UI design of `networkmind` with a robust backend structure inspired by `financial-tracker`, using Firebase Auth and Google Sheets as a database.

## Features

-   **Events Management**: Track events with List and Calendar views.
-   **Contact Management**: Manage your network, tag people with events they attended.
-   **Google Integration**:
    -   **Authentication**: Sign in with Google.
    -   **Data Sync**: Automatically syncs Contacts and Events to a Google Sheet ("NetConnect Data").
    -   **Calendar**: (Planned) Sync with Google Calendar.
